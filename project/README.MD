# Project

## Summary

The project can be *theory-oriented* and *application-oriented*. 
Note that there must be novelty in your project, no matter what 
direction you have choose. This means that you cannot just run 
an off-the-shelf machine learning algorithm/code on a public available 
toy dataset. 
Group work and discussion is encouraged. Note that the efforts from 
each of the team should be clearly documented in the project report. 
For projects of the same quality, a smaller team will get higher scores. 

*For PhD/Master students*: it is ok if you want to align the class project with your 
current research projects. HOWEVER, it cannot be results you have already 
published, and you should have additional novelty and contribution. 
Please come and talk to me if this is the case. 

It is required to use [LaTeX](http://www.latex-tutorial.com/) to format 
the project report, and use the [ACM SIG template](http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/sig-alternate-v1.1). 
The latex code for the reports, algorithm code, and experimental scripts (not data!), should be maintained by GitHub along the development.
Once the group is decided, the group leader should send me the group members and 
and also the their github ID. A project repository will be created in the 
[dedicated GitHub space](https://github.com/msu-ml). 
  

### Theory Thrust 
* Maximum group size: 3
* Design *new* machine learning algorithms with better statistical properties. 
* Focus: Algorithm development and analysis. 
* Synthetic datasets can be used in the empirical performance 
  to evaluate the algorithm/verify properties. 
* Start with reading some ICML/NIPS papers. 


### Application Thrust
* Maximum group size: 3
* Design *new* machine learning algorithms to solve *a real-world problem*. 
* Focus: Implement and compare different algorithms.  
* Data can be from SIGKDD Cup 2016 (talk to me if you are interested!) or [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions). 
* Start with reading some KDD/ICDM papers.  


## Important Dates
* Proposal due: Feb 2, 2016 
* Intermediate project report due: Mar 1, 2016
* final project presentation: Apr 26 and 28, 2016
* final project report due: Apr 28, 2016

All project deadlines are 11:59PM EST. 

## Deliverables

### Code
The code (proposal, report, and program) should be maintained in GitHub, with commits 
reflecting the efforts from each team member. 

### Project Proposal 
Project proposal (1-2 pages) should cover: 
* Project title
* Team members
* Description of the problem.
* A brief survey of what have been done and how the proposed work is different. 
* Preliminary plan (milestones)
* Reference (a list of papers)

### Intermediate Project Report 
The intermediate project report (3-5 pages) should cover:
* a high quality introduction and problem description
* description of the data used in the project
* what have you done so far
* what remains to be done

### Final Project Report 
The final project report (10-15 pages) should cover:
* Introduction, including a summary of the problem, previous work, methods, and results
* Problem description, including a detailed description of the problem you try to address
* Methodology, including a detailed description of methods used
* Results, including a detailed description of your observations from the experiments
* Conclusions and future work, including a brief summary of the main contributions of the project and the lessons you learn from the project, as well as a list of some potential future work.

### Final Project Presentation
Format:
* 10-15 minutes
* Describe the motivation and problem description
* Briefly present the intuition behind the technical details (methodology)
* Present the results
* Optionally you can use a demo.
